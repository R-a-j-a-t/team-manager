# Team Manager
Manage team members for a project

---

Imagine working on a project/task where you collaborate with people beyond your existing firm.

Say, your team includes both current and former colleagues at your firm, alongside people from other firms, freelancers, friends, family etc.

You want everybody to do their task diligently but complexity climbs up with each new member.

Remembering all of their names, tasks, when they were added to the team, contact etc can be a challenge. Not to mention getting confused over whether someone is still a part of the project (*even though they had left a week ago...!!!*).

The Team Manager web app is a solution to all these problems.

You can easily add team members, mention their current (i.e.status = active) or former (i.e. status = closed) workplace, along with any miscellaneous details, with automatic logging of the date on which they were added. In addition, it is possible to keep track of whether somebody has finished their task by ticking off a checkbox or remove them from the list if they leave. You can also sort the table based on someone's status (i.e. active or closed).

The Team Manager table can serve as the single source of truth for your project management needs and one glance is enough to give your an overview of the status of your project.
